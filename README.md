### Implementation

This is the implementation of the second programming assignment 
(https://class.coursera.org/rprog-005/human_grading/view/courses/972576/assessments/3/submissions).
A small test is implemented to make sure if the cached version is faster and if it produces 
the same result as the non-cached one.

Just in case, the test can be run by 
	source('run_tests.R')
